Brain size does not correlate with intelligence as much as with spatial skills

Vertebrate brains share the same basic plan, but different animals use some parts of their brain for different things

Cerebellum -- balance. Larger in forms that rely on fully three-dimensional motion (birds, bats, dolphins, whales) and arboreal animals (primates)

Cerebrum -- so large in humans (and some other mammals) that it overlies most of the brain; size has some correlation with intelligence
Floor of cerebrum thickens in birds (corpora striata); it was once thought to be the center for instict and that birds were incapable of learning
We didn't know much of chimpanzee behavior until someone was willing to live and spend long periods of time with them (Jane Goodall)

Reptiles exhibit complex cooperative behavior while hunting. Not just working together to pull prey apart, but also work together to catch prey (crocodiles)
Larger crocodiles even drive fish into the shallows, where smaller agile crocodiles can catch them
Crocodilians also carry young in their mouth, feed their young, and have communal nurseries (two months care and feeding)
Young then move to remote streams and live in communal burrows until they are five years old
Crocodiles and alligators apparently 'play' -- once thought to only be a mammalian behavior

Complex behavior in birds
Alex the parrot
U.K. blue tits learned how to open foil caps on milk bottles
Brown skua drink seal milk, can identify individual humans
Magpies can recognize their own reflection in a mirror
Birds are known to use a variety of simple tools in nature
Firehawks (black kite, whistling kite, brown falcon) -- all carry burning branches to new locations to flush out prey

Theropods developed more and more bird-like brains even before the development of flight
Emergence -- behavior of a collective is more complex that that of individuals (metacognition)
Loss of metacognition may have been what doomed the passenger pigeon. Having fewer and fewer animals in flocks may have caused them to be unable to function

Cretaceous Greenhouse Earth -- little evidence of glaciation anywhere, 23C average temperature (15C right now)
Tropical zone extended to 45N/S

Why?
Sea level was much higher during Cretaceous, and water absorbs solar energy more effectively than land
Rapid sea floor spreading, which displaced more water onto the continents (up to 1/3 of present land area submerged)
Ocean circulation and heat transport patterns were very different (due to more water and different position of continents)
Present ocean circulation patterns transport limited heat towards the poles, and almost none to the South Pole
Cretaceous ocean circulation patterns transported much more heat towards both poles
No large scale ice sheets, westerly winds far more seasonal, deep sea circulation patterns also changed
No constant westerly winds like today

Two main areas of modern deep water formation (where surface water sinks to ocean floor) -- North Atlantic (saline water denser), Antarctica (cooler water denser)
Sinking water brings oxygen down to lower ocean levels
Coupled with upwelling water elsewhere that brings nutrients up, this increases marine productivity
In present, this is driven by strong surface temperature gradients and constant wind patterns, neither of which existed in the Cretaceous

Cretaceous oceans often became stratified with oxygen-lean bottom water (like Minnesota lakes can during late summer)
Lack of overturn greatly increased the Cretaceous low-oxygen layer, much warmer deep ocean temperatures
Cretaceous tropical sea surface could've been up to 37C
Icthyosaurs went extinct during one of the worst of these low-oxygen periods
Little biological activity on sea floor, resulted in organic-rich black mud being deposited across much of continental shelves and sea floor
These deposits are the source of much of our present oil -- 50% of global oil comes from this 40 million year period during the Cretaceous

This only explains part of the Cretaceous warmth
Higher CO2 from extensive volcanism also played a crucial role
Upper Cretaceous seafloor spreading rates are 2x what they are now, which also led to more volcanism
CO2 levels may have been well over 3x modern levels (1000 - 1400 ppm)

Natural ice age variation in atmospheric CO2 levels ~200 - 300 ppm
Last time Earth experienced atmospheric CO2 consistently above 400 ppm is ~4 MYA (before the time of Australopithecus)
Roughly 1/4 of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is abosrbed by oceans, so ocean CO2 level is also rising
Ocean acidification (as the ocean gets less alkaline)
Makes it harder for organisms to create calcium carbonate. If pH drops low enough, it can corrode calcium carbonate
Keystone components such as corals, sea urchins, and calcified algae dramatically decrease
Many organisms remain absent around natural CO2 vents, indicating that ocean acidification would have a bad impact on ocean biodiversity
Ocean acidification played a role in the end-Permian and end-Triassic extinction (volcanism)

If algae covers the hard surfaces in a reef area, then coral cannot grow
At normal ocean temperature, coral zooxanthellae produce carbohydrates for coral
At high ocean temperature, these zooxanthellae produce oxygen radicals instead, causing coral to expel them (coral bleaching)
Bleached colonies stop growing and die
Coral reefs contain 25% of all known marine species

Diseases like Lyme disease and West Nile virus more easily spread to humans because of decreased biodiversity

First dinosaur eggshell fragments discovered in 1859 (thought they belonged to a giant bird)
Whole eggs found slightly later, and were ascribed to a crocodile
Wasn't until 1870s that they were attributed to dinosaurs (probably Hypselosaurus, a small island sauropod)

Roy Chapman Andrews's Mongolian expeditions made dinosaur eggs world famous
His first expedition was studying beaked whales, but he never encountered a living beaked whale and discovered other things instead (something of a pattern for his career)
1920s: Mongolian expeditions; goal was to find the first hominins, which Andrews thought was inside China
Curator of American Museum of National History believed humans had to have arisen in central Eurasia due to racism
He believed humans had three species (or sometimes even three genera)
They didn't find hominins, but they did find dinosaur eggs

Since Andrews's time, other areas have come into prominence for dinosaur egg studies (South America, Montana)
Most eggs are found as fragments because if the animal came alive normally, it would've broken out of its egg
Unlike tracks, eggs and nests can give hints at behavior
Dinosaur eggs are big, but not the biggest eggs known (elephant bird)

Eggs have to be waterproof, but porous enough for air to pass through
Strong enough to support the weight of brooding adults, but fragile enough that a chick can break out

Only about a dozen species of dinosaur embryos found due to difficulty of preserving embryos
Scopped nests, spiral lines, paired rows of eggs (indicating that dinosaurs had two ovaries as opposed to the one that modern birds have)
Some paleontologists suggested that sauropods gave live birth, but this doesn't seem likely
Sauropod and large ornithopod eggs tend to be spherical, theropod eggs tend to be elongated
Birds are the only living animals to get the needed calcium for egg shells from their bones (medullary bones)

Not all dinosaurs had hard shelled eggs (Protoceratops, for examples)
Only sauropods, large hadrosaurs, and theropods had hard-shelled eggsw

Angiosperms
Photosynthesis is critical to almost every ecosystem, especially terrestrial
Primary terrerstrial production is almost exclusively from plants
1% of all biomass is in the marine, 86% is terrestrial
This is largely due to plants -- 82% of all biomass

Changes in animals can lead to changes in plant cover, which then causes changes in climate
Best fossil record of plant communities comes from wet lowland areas or nearshore marine deposits
Oldest known extensive spores come from Ordovician

Late Silurian saw the first well-preserved land flora community -- a community dominated by predators and scavengers, no herbivores
It took time for non-detritus-feeding animals to evolve to digest land plants

Carboniferous was a period of large abundant wetlands with the first known large trees (and hence the first widespread coal deposits)
Large trees led to major changes in the structure of terrestrial ecosystem
Insects were the first to take advantage of these new tiers
Widespread forests and swamplands led to increased atmospheric oxygen (up to 35%)
This higher oxygen levels coupled with lack of predators meant that many insects became much larger

By the Permian, other arboreal animals were present
Elongated limbs, phalangela proportions, divergent first digit, possible prehensile tail
Pangea came fully together during the Permian --> drier climate
Terrestrial communities saw a dramatic shift from amphibian dominated fauna to reptile dominated fauna, and the plants also dramatically changed
Spore-dominated plants that were more dependent on water --> seed-dominated plants

Three main groups
Pteridophytes (spore plants -- ferns, horsetails, mosses)
Gymnosperms (seed plants -- cycads, conifers, ginkgos)
Angiosperms (flower plants -- most modern flora) (arose in mid-Cretaceous)

Grasses don't show up until the Cretaceous, and didn't dominate until the Cenozoic
Major fern radiation occurred in lower Mesozoic to become dominant low flora
Early Mesozoic landscape was covered by ferns and rushes, high foliage was dominated by cycads, conifers, and ginkgos
Living gymnosperms have relatively low nutritional value -- may have driven large dinosaur size to process low-nutrient food, which in turn drove large predator size
Gymnosperms rely on wind for fertilization and dispersal

Angiosperms had a different approach, instead relying on insects like bees for dispersal
First occur in early Cretaceous, but they underwnt a remarkable radiation in the mid Cretaceous
Gymnosperms: 60% of Triassic flora, 90% of Jurassic flora
Angiosperms: 80% of late Cretaceous flora
Presently, 250k-300k angiosperm species
Dominant vegetation of all but boreal confier forest and moss/lichen tundra (because there are fewer insects to disperse pollen)
Angiosperms are not just small flowers

Pollen gets trapped in core sediment and preserved, which is how we can find it in the fossil record

Why the rapid evolution of angiosperms? (four definite, one possible)
1. Improved photosynthesis (tied to higher CO2 levels)
2. Faster reproduction and growth (tied to 1.)
	Some gymnosperms take two years from fertilization to seed
3. Manipulation of animals/insects in fertilization (scent, flowers, nectar, chemical warfare)
4. Velcro-like structures like burrs that animals move for the plants, and seeds that pass through animal digestive systems and are dropped in fertilizer in another location. Giant ground sloths and jaguars helped disperse avocado seeds. Bird nerves do not respond to capsaicin, so they're crucial to pepper plant expansion
5. Maybe dinosaurs. Angiosperms are favored following major disruptions because they can grow faster. Pine saplings are very fragile. Change from high-browser to low-browser communities may have favored angiosperms because of their ability to grow faster than gymnosperms, which would get eaten as saplings

Beetle radiation, flies, ants, butterflies, moths, and a whole host of insect eaters
Caffeine, nicotine, strychnine, cocaine, morphine, mescaline, quinine, and codeine were all developed by angiosperms to attract pollinators and seed-dispersers
Pine scent is instead to stop animals from feeding on them; nowadays, they don't have many predators, but they were originally evolved to drive away sauropods
