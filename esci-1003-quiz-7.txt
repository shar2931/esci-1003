Pterosaurs
First large animals to fly in the Mesozoic
Late Triassic to End Cretaceous
All pterodactyls were pterosaurs, but were simply a subgroup of the pterosaur clade

Another subgroup was the rhamphorhyncoids, the basal pterosauria
Long tails that acted as rudders and full complement of teeth
Lived from Late Triassic to End Jurassic

Their descendants were pterodactyloids
Shorter tails, teeth were often modified or completely lost
More maneuverable flyers, so tails weren't necessary
Late Jurassic - End Cretaceous

Taphonomy again plays a role
As flying forms with hollow bones, they were poorly preserved
Pterosaurs traditionally thought to have arisen in the broader archosaur radiation, after crocodiles broke off and before dinosaurs differentiated into birds
Thought to have arisen from a line similar to Scleromochlus, a Late Triassic reptile
We think they gained flight from the ground up as there's no evidence of arboreal adaptations in the line
From the skull and jaws, this ancestor was likely an insect-eater
Pair of skeletons found in collapsed dune suggests it was a gregarious desert dweller
Large eyes suggest possible nocturnal lifestyle
Length and design of rear limbs suggest saltation locomotion (like kangaroos), which may have led to flight

First non-insect animals to achieve true powered flight, long before a line of theropods became birds
Largest pterosaurs were about the height of a giraffe, and smallest were hand-sized
The largest would've only weighed about 450-500lb
Most derived pterosaurs, like Quetzalcoatlus, were the largest flying animals ever
Independently evolved 'fuzz' (not true fur), made up of pycnofibers, hair-like filaments
Pyconfibers covered pterosaur head, limbs, and body (but not the wings)
Suggests pterosaurs were warm-blooded
Independently evolved hollow, bone-like birds with internal struts to support the bone

Pterosaurs initially appear to have unusually large skulls and limbs for their size
Larger bone diameters, even though they're hollow, are better for withstanding the bending stresses of powered flight
Pteranodon had a wingspan of 6-7.5m, but its bone walls were only 1mm thick and it only may have weighed 25 pounds (about the same as the largest flying birds)

Also independently evolved brains designed for 3D flight, well-developed optic lobes, and enlarged cerebrums and cerebellums
Reflects high levels of coordination and balance

First fossil described by Cosimo Alessandro Collini in 1784, who thought it was a marine form that used its forelimbs to swim
Influenced by the fact that it was found in marine settlements
Cuvier was the first to suggest it flew in 1801
Sample lost for decades in a museum drawer, but it was found again

Gideon Mantell and Mary Anning also found more pterosaur fossils, as well as Mary Moreland Buckland and William Buckland
'Fur' recognized in 1831, bird-like brain in 1888 (both size and structure)
Pterosaur endothermy was proposed in 1901 on the basis of their specialized lungs and air sacs
If pterosaurs had survived to present, Linnaeus would've likely classified them in their own group separate from reptiles, as he did birds

In 'Dinosaur Dark Ages,' interpretations of pterosaurs changed from efficient flyers to inefficient, clumsy gliders
In reality they were well adapted to active flight
Pterosaur wing was supported by greatly extended fourth digit
Unlike bird wings which are supported by arm bones, or bat wings in which each of four wings supports a fleshy membrane
Bird wings have three highly fused digits at the end, but the pterosaur has three clawed fingers that are not part of the wing at all

They had two structures unique to pterosaur flight
Fusion of vertebrae close to shoulder called notarium provided more stability during flight
Pteroid bone in arm, which sort of looks like a thumb, provided control over front of flight membrane
Pteroid was a modified wrist bone, similar to panda's 'thumb' or mole's sixth 'digit'

Also had keeled sternums like modern birds, although not as large in pterosaurs because they had less dense bodies
Stiff wing fibers called 'actinofibrils' provided structural support and allowed control over wing shape and position
Occurred in layers that had different orientations

Flight membrane in pterosaurs was not a single structure, but a complex supported by different parts of the pterosaur anatomy
Fourth digit and forelimb, along with pteroid bone and rear limbs
Flight muscles comprised a significant amount of body weight
Air sac system extended into wing mass

Pterosaurs flew for 150my, filling many niches and evolving a wide variety of crests
Best preserved pterosaurs flew in coastal areas
Diving lifestyle confirmed by a preserved collision between a pterosaur and billed fish

Not all fish eating animals had teeth, and the same is true of pterosaurs
Some pterosaurs also used their beaks for opening shellfish
Some even ate tiny organisms from the water like baleen whales and flamingos (Pterodaustro)
Even this is a small sample of their overall lifestyle

A majority of living pterosaurs may well have been terrestrial carnivores and insectivores
They had hard-shelled eggs laid in communal nesting sites
Indications of parental cares
Other finds indicate soft shelled eggs, buried in moist ground which were then abandoned
The line found with soft sheleld eggs also has the first distinctive sex-distinguishing features
Debate continues over altrical vs. precocial young, or perhaps both

Some pterosaurs definitely lived in colonies
Exhibited remarkable array of decorative crests, although some didn't have any
Suggests social role for crests such as age and sex identification

Early on it was assumed that pterosaurs declined as birds arose and diversified, because it was assumed that birds were better fliers
With the exception of hummingbirds and swifts, pterosaurs may have been more fully committed to flight than birds
May have retained their clawed digits to stay on the ground, because they may have had difficulty doing so otherwise
This greater commitment to flight may have been their downfall

Bird skeletons are simply modifications of theropods which lived on the ground, explaining why birds can hang out on the land or in the water well
Some birds prefer being on land (turkeys, roadrunners), and some abandoned flight entirely
But pterosaurs seem like they are not great at being on land, which could've given the birds a crucial advantage
Unclear the extent to which pterosaurs and birds overlapped niches
During periods of extreme stress, the greater degree of parental care may have given birds an advantage over pterosaurs

Angiosperms did not exist for much of pterosaur history
First animals to engage in trans-ocean transportation of seeds and microbes
Although pterosaurs declined as birds rose, the largest pterosaurs still lived until the end of the Cretaceous

End-Cretaceous (K-Pg) Extinction

Possibly 75% of all species lost
Often presented as 150 million year reign of reptiles (in land, air, and sea) brought to an abrupt end, but this is untrue
Dinosaurs were continually going extinct (as all species do)
It was a mass extinction (not just dinosaurs and their reptilian relatives)

Largest known mass extinction occurred at the end of the Permian, in which 96% of marine species and 70% of all life on land died
Mass extinctions allow the creation of a clean slate for new evolutionary radiations -- survivors inherit a world largely free of competitors
End-Permian mass extinction allowed for radiation of reptiles
End-Triassic mass extinction eliminated many dinosaur competitors (archosaurs), allowing dionsaurs to radiate
K-Pg extinction in turn allowed mammals and birds to dominate the land

Mass extinctions are times when the rate of species loss is well above the background levels
Three different types of extinctions:
1. True extinction -- 'end of a line,' where a line of species simply comes to an end, e.g. pterosaurs and non-avian dinosaurs at the end of Cretaceous
   It's tough to define a species inside the fossil record
2. Apparent extinction -- when species A evolves towards species B over time, e.g. small theropods that led to birds. 
   Most extinctions are of this type. Also called pseudo-extinction
3. False extinction -- when a species dies out, and then comes back some time later. This is due to a gap in the fossil record, rather than the animal re-appearing
   E.g. coelacanths, which were considered to be extinct until very recently

Various incorrect theories for dinosaur extinction
1. Mammals eating dinosaur eggs -- mammals and dinosaurs arose at the same time, so why would they suddenly start eating dinosaur eggs en masse when they hadn't for 150 million years.

2. Dinosaurs got to be too big or too old -- unlikely because dinosaurs came in a massive range of sizes.

3. Dinosaurs got cataracts from increased solar radiation.

4. Temperature-dependent sex differentiation in a warming world led to dinosaurs being all of one sex

Who are the victims and survivors of K-Pg extinction?
Victims: dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, ammonites, rudists and reef, some plankktin
Survivors: birds, lizards, snakes, sea turtles, crocodiles, nautiloids, sharks and fish, some plankton, mammals, amphibians

Amphibians are some of the most sensitive species to environmental change today, so how did they survive?
The victims were primarily herbivores and carnivores, the survivors were omnivores, insectivores, carrion-eaters, and detritus feeders
Victims are wholly dependent on primary productivity, survivors are more opportunistic
During K-Pg extinction, opportunistic fern spores dominated (which can be seen in fossil record)
Fresh water ecosystems seemed to have the highest survival rate
Shallow water calcareous plankton groups were hit hard, but deeper marine forms were relatively unaffected
Apart from crocodiles, no animal larger than 25 kg survived

Stream ecosystems tend to rely more on detritus from land than primary productivity
Similarly, organisms that live in the water column tend to rely on primary productivity
Slow growing crocodile young feed primarily on invertebrates and dead organisms

Changes in atmospheric oxygen levels (based on bubbles trapped in amber)
Data suggests O2 levels dropped precipitously at end of Cretaceous (from 35% to 28%) -- during Late Permian it dropped down to 14%
But this data is extremely limited and bubbles might have leaked, so this is very questionable data

Volcanism
Deccan Traps in India (which was then on top of the Reunion hotspot in Indian ocean) led to massive areas being covered in kilometers of lava
They date to K/Pg boundary
Massive lava flows with associated volcanic particles and gas alter composition of atmosphere and ocean, just as with the end-Permian extinction
Eruptions would've produced dust clouds and acid aerosols that blocked sunlight and interrupted photosynthesis
Acid rain and ocean acidification could destroy land plants and phytoplankton
Eruptions also produced tremendous amounts of CO2, which caused rapid global warming after the initial cooling period

Asteroid
Walter and Luis Alvarez team 'discovered' that a clay layer in Italy marking K-Pg boundary was rich in iridium 
Actually discovered by Isabella Premoli Silva
Normal iridium levels only 0.3 ppb, but can be as high as 3000 ppb in some meteorites
In this clay layer, iridium levels were up to 9 ppb
This layer is present all across the world
Microscopic ejecta (tiny glass spheres) and shocked quartz, which only occurs inside really high-stress conditions (extreme volcanism, atomic bomb site)
Eventually, the crater was located in the Yucatan peninsula
The hole has since been filled in by sediment, but subsurface studies have shown the presence of a big hole there that was since filled in
Meteor craters tend to be circular regardless of direction of approach due to their great speed
Models suggest a 60 degree approach, which would've generated a lot of atmospheric heat on its approach
Heat triggered continent-scale wildfires and smoke from those fires encircled the globe to screen out sunlight
These fires could've caused oxygen drop
Yucatan shelf is also rich in hydrocarbons, which would be ignited by the impact to put tremendous amounts of soot in the atmosphere
Hot ejecta falling back down through atmosphere may have raised atmosphere's tempartures to hundreds of C for several hours, killing many large animals
Followed by a few years of extreme cooling as sulfur aerosols decreased sunlights, which was then followed by global warming
Photosynthesis completely curtailed for months, and greatly reduced for years

Our best estimate is that the Deccan volcanism began first (~250ky before impact), so the impact did not trigger volcanism
Impact may have accelerated volcanic activity by sending shock waves through the Earth
Wai Subgroup lava flows that comprise over 70% of the Deccan Traps eruption could have been triggered by the impact
Impact also may have caused a significant spike in volcanic activity along the Earth's seafloor ridges

The K-Pg impact's impacts did not end in the Cretaceous
Classic-era Mayan civilization settled in the Yucatan but away from the coast (to avoid hurricane impacts)
Abrupt decline in 900 CE, Mayan cities in southern lowlands abandoned, and only in northern coastal areas did the civilization continue
200-year drought starting around 900 CE, which led Mayans to abandon southern cities
Northern Yucatan has massive cenotes, permanent water supply
Asteroid impact fractured rock throughout the Yucatan, which eventually led to the formation of cenotes in these brittle rocks

Megafauna Extinction

Cave paintings ('parietal art') are found all across Eurasia
Probably started by Neanderthals, but when humans came to Eurasia, they started painting animals
While some of these animals seem familiar, many are not
Mammoths and mastodons, cave lions, wooly rhinos (although they may have survived up until 10kya), aurochs

Cuvier was the first to propose extinction (especially mass extinction)
Darwin became convinced of Charles Lyell's non-catastrophic view of Earth's history

Recent recognition that there had been an Ice Age made it seem like there must have been a tie between climate and extinction
But they also recognized that early humans may have been a cause of extinction as well
Lyell favored the climatological cause

The loss of species over the last 50,000 years is one of the six largest mass extinctions, but it is unique in that it specifically targeted large animals
Extinction first began in Africa 120ky ago
Australia's began 46ky ago and was far more devastating
North America sooner, and Madagascar sooner yet

African and southern Asian megafauna evolved alongside humans so they were less affected

Oxygen is toxic to many organisms, including the anaerobic bacteria that comprised muhc of the Earth's early life
Photosynthetic organisms led to a mass extinction of anaerobic bacteria
First non-complete mass extinction may haeve occurred as photosynthetic organisms became stromatolites
715mya, Earth nearly completely froze ('ice ball' or more likely 'slush ball' Earth)
Resulting extinxtion may have paved the way for evolution of multi-cellular organisms (maybe by increasing oxygen levels)

Even once multi-cellular life got going things went wrong
Four major extinctions in the Cambrian period
Probably linked to anoxic deep water upwelling into shallow water community or cooling climate (likely former)

End-Ordovician mass extinction may have bene due to a period of extreme glaciation
Not only quickly cooled global climate but significantly dropped sea level
At this point, all life is in the ocean and most of it on the shallow continental shelf

End-Devonian mass extinction may have been due to land plants
First land plants broke up rocks and soil, greatly accerlerating nutrient cycling
All the excess nutrients from the terrestrial systems ended up in the ocean
This created algal blooms that made the ocean anoxic which toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide
Again affecting shallow marine life

Reef systems were hit with a massive extinction several million years before End-Permian extinction, which may have made the End-Permian extinction worse
End-Permian due to massive volcanism, End-Triassic as well (that eliminiated many of the dinosaurs' competitors)
End-Cretaceous due to both massive volcanism and an asteroid impact

Most recent big mass extinction of the fossil record is due to humans

First mammals arose in the Late Triassic, and were very diverse with arboreal and even gliding forms known
Of the three living groups of mammals, the oldest are monotreme (Teinolophos which lived ~120mya in Australia)
Genetic studies suggest that monotremes first arose in Late Triassic or Early Jurassic (unlikely the the first one would be preserved in the fossil record)
Living monotremes include platypus and echidnas, which lay eggs and have a cloaca (like dinosaurs and birds)

Oldest known marsupial was Sinodelphys which lived about 125 mya in China, genetic studies suggest marsupials first arose in the Middle Jurassic
Oldest true placental mammal may have arisen in the post K-Pg radiation, but its Eutherian ancestors are known from China and lived ~160mya
Purgatorius found at Purgatory Hill, MT was once thought to be the earliest primate but it's now considered an ancestral form (identified in Pillsbury Hall)

Pregnancy is less dangerous in marsupials vs placental mammals because young are much smaller upon birth

Prior to the K-Pg extinction, most mammals were small nocturnal insectivores (got up to size of a small pig)
Within a few million years of the extinction some mammals weighed up to 50 kg, and 750kg mammals existed by the end of the Paleogene
Paraceratherium was not only the largest known terrestrial mammal, but also possibly the largest animal possible with a mammalian style of respiration
It took nearly 10 million years for mammals to get big, and some reptiles took advantage of that time
Crocodiles and snakes also got bigger in this time
Giant herbivorous birds in northern continents and even bigger carnivorous birds across S. America

As in the Mesozoic, terrestrial forms go back into the sea
There are nearly twice as many bird species as mammals species -- in terms of dinosaurs, we are still in a dinosaur world

Mesozoic is the time when modern ecosystems first arose
First high-browsers, first large animal herds, first angiosperms, first social insects, and first complex plant/animal interactions, and first non-insect powered flight
Mesozoic also saw the first land animals return to the sea
All the modern plankton groups arise in the Mesozoic
One piece missing -- grasses and grasslands

Although grasses arose before the end of the Cretaceous (oldest grass fossil ~100mya, may have arisen 25my earlier) and dinosaurs fed on them,
Grasslands didn't expand until after the K-Pg extinction and now cover ~40% of the Earth's arable surface
First grasslands began to spread about 30mya and their spread altered animal communities
Rodents were the main grass herbivores for a while, but as grasslands spread large mammals began to eat them
In response grass evolved various methods of defense
Covered leaves with fibers and secreted silica in their tissue to make it harder to digest and wear down animal teeth
Many grazing animals went extinct, others developed tall-crowned teeth like modern horses (with thick enamel coverings)
Grasses countered again by moving the meristem (part of the plant responsible for its growth) closer to the ground
Alloweded grasses to recover quickly from grazing
Flat open grasslands make it harder to hunt
Modern predators arose due to modern grasslands (cats and dogs)

40mya, Antarctica separates and freezes over, which cools global climate
15-12mya, Africa connects with Eurasia; elephants, mastodons, and apes leave Africa, giraffes, rhinos, antelope, and many others enter Africa
3mya, Americas unite and life exchange happens
Pattern of ocean currents changed because of Americas; all the moisture and warm air hitting polar regions caused lots of snow, which cooled global climate
First ice ages since the Carboniferous begin 3 mya, along with the rise of hominins
3mya, tool use expansion by Australopithecus afarensis
70kya (or earlier), humans go 'out of Africa' and across the world

Just as important as recent megafauna extinctions is a new burst of evolution that occured within the last 10,000 years
Humans domesticating plants and animals
Flora and fauna that we like and use have undergone a remarkable radiation at the expense of non-domesticated forms
15kya, dogs were domesticated in Eurasia and probably elsewhere
10kya, sheep in Middle East
8kya, cattle and pigs
6kya, horses (in central Eurasia)
4.5kya, llamas in Peru

15,000 wolves in U.S., and only 5,500 in lower 48 (Estimated ~400,000 before European settlement)
But there are 90 million dogs in the U.S.

Corn, wheat, and rice are twice as extant as the next 7 crops combined
Now, we use the same varieties of these plants

Domestication has greatly decreased global biodiversity
Clair Patterson led campaign to remove lead from our environment, resulting in the 1970 Clean Air Act
Rachel Carson led campaign to reduce widespread pesticide use, leading to creation of E.P.A.
Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall led movement to ban use of bird feathers in many clothes
