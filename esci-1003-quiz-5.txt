Ceratopsians
Arose and diversified in East Asia, spread to N. America
Characterized by beak, horns, and frill; mostly quadrupedal
Bipedal ancestor of ceratopsians had a beak but no horns or frills, and was small
Similar evolution to ornithopods -- beaks, cheek-equivalent structures, and dental batteries evolve over time
Ceratopsians likely ate tougher, woody plants compared to ornithopods

Two forms with more ancestral features
Psittacosaurus
Small biped, no frill, no horns, but its beak is distinctive of protoceratops and ceratopsians
Very triangular skull
Large gut area relative to its size
Large eyes suggest good vision, relatively large brain suggests complex behavior
Body shape is simiilar to theropods, which led some to suggest that it may have been a scavenger

However, it's the only ceratopsian known to have gastroliths
Gastroliths are found in a number of species today, like chickens, crocodiles, and axolotls
Gastric mill in gizzard to abrade food (birds) -- widely assumed for dinosaurs in older texts, but may only be true in ornithomimosaurs and psittacosaurus
Ballast or stability for diving and swimming (crocodiles, plesiosaurs, seals and toothed whales) -- definitely not for dinosaurs, and possibly not for others
Mixing stomach fluids, like a stir bar -- may have been used in some dinosaur lines
Accidental ingestion is also possible -- appears to be the most likely reason for gastroliths found in some sauropod lines
Composition of gastroliths attests to the strength of stomach acids -- they're made almost entirely of quartz	
Psittacosaurus likely used gastroliths for abrasion and mixing stomach fluids

Well-preserved Psittacosaurus found in China
Probably were muted brownish color with countershading because they would've been a prey animal
It could slide its jaw back and forth to shear food
Unlike parrots and most ceratopsians, beaks were rounded and flat rather than curved
Beak may have been well-adapted to opening nuts and seeds
High encephalization may have suggested complex social behavior
One of the best-documented dinosaur genera -- up to 11 known species all from eastern Eurasia, 100s of relatively complete specimens
Well-documented ontogeny (specimens from many different stages in the animals' life) and sexual dimorphism (though we don't know which is which)
Herd of six juvenile Psittacosaurus buried by a volcanic mudflow, from at least two age groups from two distinct clutches
Suggests group fidelity and gregariousness beyond the nest
Even youngest psittacosaur teeth found are worn -- suggests they may have been precocial, leaving the nest as soon as they hatch
Repenomamus robustus -- mammal about the size of a domestic pig has remains of a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its stomach
34 articulated juvenile Psittacosaurus skeletons with the skull of an adult -- recent work suggests skull belonged to immature adult (caretaking)

Other ancestral form
Protoceratops
No horns, but had frill and beak
Small quadrupedal form; longer tails than in more derived ceratopsians, so it's still in the transition from bipedalism
Relatively small dinosaur with a disproportionately large skull, supported by fusion of neck vertebrae behind skull
Size of skull was reason for quadruped stance
Beak, cheek-equivalent structures, dozens of teeth for slicing food (not quite a dental battery)
Deep jaws and base of frill area provide large spaces for jaw muscles (remarkably powerful bite for its size)
Scissors-like back and forth motion for jaws
Different frills in protoceratops were first recognition of sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs

Protoceratops eggs were well-known
Roy Chapman Andrews led expeditions to Mongolia in order to find the first hominins -- he instead found dinosaur nests and eggs, pretending like that's what he was looking for all along
Andrews expedition found Oviraptor skeleton sprawled over Protoceratops nest
Didn't recognize nor record Oviraptor skeleton position -- it was actually an Oviraptor brooding its own nest
Had soft-shelled eggs like modern reptiles
Possible that dinosaur ancestors had soft-shelled eggs, and sauropods and other groups later developed hard-shelled eggs
Protoceratops and Velociraptor fossils found locked in a fight to the death
Protoceratops may have given rise to legends of gryphons
Greek writers refer to gryphons as living contemporaenous animals -- bones of fossils in Altai Mountains are pure white, so appear living

Ceratopsians
Some of the largest skulls of any land animal
Because of skull size, they must be quadrupeds
Tail wasn't used for balance any longer, but it wasn't vestigial
Tail muscles used for locomotion, tail possibly used for heat shedding
Young of all species are nearly indistinguishable
One vestigial toe, 4 weight-bearing toes
Highly-evolved hip structure with 10-12 fused sacral vertebrae (sauropods only have 6)
Large nasal openings, powerful jaw with large frill for muscle attachment (at base of frill)
Curved beak at front to crop plants
Well-developed dental battery, double-rooted teeth that stack and interlock with one another
May be tied to the rise of angiosperms

How do ceratopsians and ornithopods avoid competition?
Ornithopods had weaker but more mobile jaws, maybe because they ate softer plants (still tough enough to wear a tooth away within 2-3 months)
Dental batteries and beaks of ceratopsians are specialized for slicing

Some recent work suggests that Triceratops may be a more adolescent version of Torosaurus
Solid frill of Triceratops is atypical
Skull has some subadult characteristics
Two overlap in range, no juvenile Triceratops known while Triceratops has well-understood ontogeny
Would have implications for herd structure (Triceratops reach sexual maturity before they reach physical maturity)
However, other recent work suggests that some Torosaurus were immature and that some Triceratops had fully fused skulls

Still some debate about erect vs. semi-sprawled stance for Triceratops
Main purpose of horns is likely social competition and social dominance (like bison)
Strong evidence of herdsing

Ornithopoda
Part of Cerapoda with Ceratopsians, characterized by only having enamel on one side of their teeth
Late Triassic to End of Cretaceous, very successful lineage
Range in size from <1 meter to over 15 meters long
Three-toed feet, although many of the early forms had four toes

Come to prominence during Cretaceous; dominance on northern continents is not mirrored in South (although still present on all landmasses)
Might be responsible for sauropod decline in North America, or regional sauropod extinction allowed their rise
Includes Iguanadon
Elephant-sized animals that still had communal nesting areas
These animals (especially the small ones) had feathers
Chronologically, the first plant-eating idnosaurs to acquire cheek-equivalent structures
Multiple interlocking tooth rows (dental batteries)
True chewing
First bipedal herbivores to fill most size niches

Trends Through Time
Part 1: Eating
Snout becomes longer and broader
Front teeth lost in favor of horny beak
Increased number and complexity of teeth
Teeth as tools: dagger (theropods), rake (some sauropods), scissors (stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, and ceratopsians), tenderizer (ornithopods)
Both the scissors and tenderizer are used in chewing
Ornithopods are vastly increased surface area of food through chewing, which aids in digesting vegetation
Skull and jaw design allowed very elaborate chewing motion

Part 2: Locomotion
Increased body size and arm length
Largest became non-obligatory quadrupeds (can run away on two legs if they need to)
Early ornithopods were small, fast-moving bipeds that relied on speed to escape predators
Evolved many of the same features for fast movement seen in small theropods (small upper limb, long lower limb, extended ankle, digitigrade stances)
Hands become increasingly adapted for bearing weight (fewer digits, fewer bones in each digit, bones become shorter and more robust)
Increased number of sacral vertebrae fused to hip
Largest ornithopods become the largest non-sauropods

Part 3: Non-feeding Skull Features
Many develop elaborate crests or complex nasal passages
Complexity is not limited to skull's exterior
Increased encephalization quotient

Small ancestors: Heterodonts
Late Triassic (?) to Early Jurassic, generally poor record of them
Tend to be small, agile bipeds with long tails; seem similar to theropods
Pubis bone points back unlike theropods, specialized teeth (including tusks)
Skulls have recessed areas for cheek-equivalent structures, teeth designed for cutting vegetation (not just raking it into mouth)
Jaw has multiple joints unlike single-jointed theropod jaws (which just went up and down)
Gracile skeletons, slender feeth with elongated digits for rapid movement
Hands not adapted for bearing weight
Defense - agility, speed, and herding behavior
Tusks are more likely to be display within species than defense
Herding behavior makes it more difficult to target one individual

Drinker nisti and Othnielia rex (might actually be the same genera)
Leaellynasaura, found on Australia which at the time was connected with Antarctica and was polar
Antarctica in the Cretaceous was a temperate rainforest
Some Antarctic ornithopods may have burrowed during the long polar winters (and ornithopods in Montana and South Korea)

Coprolites are fossilized excrement
Surprisingly, carnivore coprolites are more common than herbivores
Coprolites can give essential info on diet and physiology, including record fo some otherwise poorly-preserved organisms

Some potential problems:
Different animals can produce similar feces
The same animal can also produce very different feces
Coprolite size does not necessarily reflect animal size (deer vs. rabbit)

Hadrosaurs (Late Cretaceous)
Climax of ornithopod radiation
Multiple rows of interlocking teeth
Enamel was only on one side, so teeth were self-sharpening
Cross-section of Edmontosaurus tooth has six main tissues
May be the most complex teeth of any vertebrate
True chewing, jaw joint set lower than teeth (jaws come together like nutcracker rather than scissors motion)
Wide horn-covered beak for cropping

Longer forelimbs, non-obligatory quadrupeds
Remarkable diversity of heads, remarkable uniformity in body form
Feet are similar to iguanadonts (three toes), hands have lost thumb spike (four digits)

Two main skull types
Lambeosaurines (head crests); may have been able to inflate their crests
Saurolophines (flat-heads)
Apparently successful enough that hadrosaurs largely replaced sauropods in northern continents
Largest non-sauropod dinosaurs

Like sauropods, hadrosaurs were originally interpreted as semi-aquatic
Crests are probably used for socialization and vocalization
Shapes change with sex and maturity
Herding was their defense against predators
Mass burial site of Maiasaurus -- estimated 10,000 individuals
Tail muscles of hadrosaurs suggest that they had good manouverability when running

Communal nesting grounds
Crushed egg shells suggest young are staying in nests (which means they are being fed)
3 meter juveniles still in nests
Small juveniles lack ossified joints, meaning they couldn't walk away
No evidence of brooding, although that has limited taphonomic potential and is unlikely for large animals
