Theropods
Among the earliest dinosaurs, definitely the last dinosaurs (birds)
Ancestral theropods primarily predators, but they diversified over time (by the end of the Cretaceous)
Birds further expanded the diversity of theropods

Analogies for land terrestrial predators: cats, dogs, hyenas (the big land predators today)
Differences between theropods and mammal predators?
	- Size: Not as great a difference as is often made out
		Many theropods were small and many prey animals were larger than today's prey

	- Feathers vs. Fur: Huge difference
		Feathers have many uses, including brooding, stability, and eventually flight in birds
	
	- Continual tooth replacement: Moderate
		Saber-toothed cats had to be careful with their teeth because they only had two

	- Hollow bones and bird-like lung and air sac system: Theropods breath through their bones as well
		Mammalian lungs: air moves in and out in two-way motion, no oxygen taken in during exhalation
		Avian flow-through system: Air moves in one direction and is temporarily stored in air sacs
		Air in air sacs allows oxygen to be taken in during exhalation
		Greater efficiency allows flight and breathing at high elevation

	- Egg laying vs. live birth: Major difference
		Mammalian live birth means that many species have inherent chauvinism, with one male mating with many females (harem)
		Most birds do not have harems, and some that do have a dominant female with many males
		Easier to have two birds take care of one nest

	- Bipedal locomotion: Major difference
		Some smaller theropods may have had wing-assisted incline running or flight

Differences between extinct theropods and birds?
So much of modern birds' lives revolve around flight or their ancestors' flight, so they're not always the best analogy for dinosaurs

All theropods share the same basic blueprint because it worked really well for predation
Amongst all dinosaur groups, theropods are most conservative in their design
	- Skeleton: 
		Lightly built (gracile) bones
		Even bigger forms like Allosaurus look huge from the side, but from above they are actually very sleek and narrow
		Pneumatic (hollow) vertebrae, limbs
		Hollow bones is why Owen could predict moas' existence from a single hollow bone fragment
	- Lungs:
		Reduce weight, which increases speed, but most importantly they are part of bird-like flow through lung system
		Avian-like respiration also helped in heat-shedding

	- Limbs:
		Rear limbs have runner proportions (short upper bones, long lower bones, extended ankles)
		Digitigrade stance leads to running on the bottoms of the toes, which extends the length of the leg and thus the stride and speed
		Despite T. rex's short arms (and some other large theropods), most smaller theropods had long forelimbs
		Younger T. rexs also have long arms, but at about 10 years old, their body goes through a growth spurt that skips the arms
		Compsognathus -> Sinovenator -> Archaeopteryx; forelimbs get progressive longer and longer

	- Skull:
		Skull is typically thin boned with numerous openings and flexible design
		Even in Allosaurus, much of the skull is hollow
		This is to provide flexibility when biting into struggling prey
		Not all theropods had this though -- T. rex had massive jaws to kill prey in one bite

	- Eyes:
		Most theropods probably had stereoscopic vision with (almost) forward-facing eyes (in order to determine distances)

	- Brains:
		Relatively large brains for social skills and possibily social interactions (hunting in packs)

	- Jaws:
		Vertically oriented jaws to withstand bite pressures
		Just like how boards that support a ceiling aren't on their flat end, they're on their side so that they don't bend as much
		Space for continual tooth replacement
	
	- Teeth:
		Teeth typically sharp with serrated edges and complete enamel coating for added strength
		Deep sockets, strongly rooted
		Most were blade-like, but not all (T. rex teeth were spear-pointed instead)

	- Feathers:
		Smaller theorpods likely had feathers, which indicates endothermy
		Feathers are among the most complex integumentary structures, but they didn't start out that way
		Feathers originally did not evolve for flight
	
		Earliest feathers were hollow tubes, and looked very hair-like
		Tubes evolved into a barb cluster
		Then, barbs base fused to form rachis or barbs formed branching barbules (unclear which came first)
		Barbules evolved interlocking hooks to form flat vanes)
		Lastly, feathers became asymmetric for powered flight

		Feathers likely arose for insulation
		Also likely used for social displays and sex identifications
		Used for brooding, trapping body heat against the nest
		Camoflauge, courtship rituals, even for burts of speed (especially up inclines, as feathers could drive arms down)
		Feathers could also be used for subduing prey, allowing dinos to balance on struggling prey
		Only one line of theropods ended up using feathers for flight

		Most large theropods had scales, but some may have had feathers

	- Reproduction:
		Theropod lines supply most direct evidence of parental care
		Many fossils have been found in a brood position over nests

Theropod Groups:
Classification? Within group, relationships are often debatable due to groups' overall poor taphonomy
At present, Eodromaeus is the earliest known theropod, and Ceolophysoidea were among the earliest theropods (with feathers!)

Scores of Ceolophysis found in Ghost Ranch at New Mexico
Originally interpreted as evidence of large pack behavior, but now reinterpreted as animals gathering at water holes during drought later buried by flash floods
Georgia O'Keefe may have been inspired by Coelophysis fossils at Ghost Ranch
An archosaur found with Coelophysis at Ghost Ranch named Effigia okeeffeae

Early Jurassic: some theropods got larger, such as Dilophosaurus
Unlike in Jurassic Park, it didn't have a crest or spit poison -- it didn't need to because it was the largest predator of its time
State dino of Connecticut despite no fossils being found there

Middle Jurassic: theropods dominated by two groups: tetanurae and certasauria
	
Tetanurae (stiff-tails):
	Dominate northern continents
	Most abundant and diverse group, from hummingbird-size to some of largest land predators
	Birds are included in this group
	Group name arises from tendence for tail vertebrae modifications
	Long processes on distal tail allow shifting of tail weight quickly, which allows for quicker running

	Some lines developed retractable talon on foot, coupled with adapations for leaping and kicking
	Velociraptor had long stiff tail and talons
	Protoceratops and Velociraptor fossils found in a fight with each other

	Some evidence of pack attacks on larger prey
	Montana: Large dinosaur was kiled by Velociraptors, but a number of sickle claws was found near the prey fossil indicating several velociraptors present

	Ornithomimosaurs (bird mimic reptiles) thought to look like ostriches
	Similar shape and size, but with long arms and tails
	Long tail allowed Ornithomimus to run with its full leg, meaning it could go even faster
	Light, delicate skull without teeth
	Often assumed to be omnivores, and had a keratin beak which helped to stabilize skull bunes

	Limusaurus
	Young had teeth, but adults lost their teeth and developed a beak instead

	Oviraptorosaurs look like Ornithomimosaurs from the head down, but had different head
	Short snout, very powerful jaw, and a rigid rib cage similar to modern birds
	Bone in throat area similar to that of modern egg-eaters, but many alternatives possible
	However, its beak could be used to catch quick, agile prey like rodents or lizards
	It could be a brooding animal and an egg-eater
	Big, powerful beak could also be used for breaking shellfish shells or nuts or seeds

	Therizinosaurs
	Long neck, stout torsos, immense unguals (claws) on hands
	Claws seem like they could be used to kill prey
	Jaws and teeth differ from those of a typical theropod
	Thin jaws, not super sharp teeth
	Hips: pubis bone is beginning to become parallel with the ilium like ornithiscians, not like most theropds, which would increase gut area
	One analogy for therizinosaurs is large ground sloths, which also had big claws. They used their claws to dig up tubers and pull branches down
	Another analogy is ant-eaters; termites did arise in the Cretaceous
	However, if Therizinosaurus was eating ants and termites it wouldn't have needed the big guts
	Therizinosaurus was a huge animal

Big Theropoda
By Cretaceous, theropods are exploring other diets and lifestyles, but their ancestral condition and dominant lifestyle was predation
By Mesozoic, predation was nothing new to Earth's terrestrial ecosystems
Silurian period had the first terrestrial ecosystems, but was entirely dominated by predators and scavengers -- nothing ate live land plants
Took time for non-detritus feeding animals to evolve to digest land plants

Number of different large theropods during Jurassic and Cretaceous suggests a huge prey base
Had differences in hunting styles and targeted resources -- "niche partitioning" (like cheetahs and lions in same environment)
Spotted vs. striped hyena: striped are nocturnal and scavenge, spotted are diurnal and predate

Allosaurus (Jurassic):
Allosaurus skull is very lightly designed despite its size, giving it flexibility when it bites something
Some possible evidence of parental care
Trackways show packs of Allosaurus-sized hunters

Tyrannosaurus (Cretaceous):
Tyrannosaurs came in a variety of sizes
Both T. rex and Triceratops both descended from Eurasian immigrants
In the case of T. rex, its Eurasian ancestor Moros intrepidus was only about 1 meter tall and weighed ~78kg (96 MYA, Utah)
Within 15 million years, T. rex is 4 meters tall and 7000kg. How?

Middle Cretaceous has a relatively poor rock record, but may have been a time of high stress and lot of extinction events
Period of ocean anoxia led to the death of many marine species including Ichthyosaurs (possibly tied to seafloor volcanism, weak overturn due to warmer climate)
In terrestrial ecosystem, extinction events got Carcharodontosaurus, then the apex predator of N. America
Opened a niche for T. rex

Adolescent T. rex had a very different design than adult
Leg proportion designed for rapid running
Arms bigger for the body than adults
Skulls are more reminiscent of an Allosaurus skull (young, more gracile, with slender jaws)
Even within T. rex, we may be seeing niche partitioning
Each age (and T. rex may have only lived 30 years) utilizes different resources

T. rex is not the most typical theropod (as with many famous members of a group of dinosaurs)
It originally seemed to be so unusual that a debate arose about if it was a predator or a scavenger
Dr. Jack Horner (basis for Alan Grant) was a fervent proponent of the scavenger theory
Dr. Robert Bakker (basis for Burke in JP2) was a proponent of the predator theory ("roadrunner from hell")

Heavier build than most theropods. What does that mean in terms of speed?
Long powerful legs, but not clearly a runner design
For T. rex, a fall running at 35 mph would probably be fatal
T. rex's legs were so long that it didn't need to run super fast, it had long strides

Arms?
Used for balance when getting up from sleep? Sexual purpose?
It turned out that short arms weren't that rare, and that T. rex arms are only really short in the adult form
Arms also had powerful extensor muscles and elbow flexors to hold onto struggling prey
In adult T. rexs, head becomes huge (and consequently the neck, which attaches to the shoulder blades)
Arm muscles stay the same size to accomodate for the neck muscles getting big

Adult skull design different from Allosaurus and many other large theropods
T. rex skull doesn't have much empty space, a lot heavier bones and much wider
Relatively small eyes for skull and large nostrils (suggests a scavenger)
But it also had best stereoscopic vision of most theropod dinosaurs (and most birds save owls)
Had larger than expected brain given its body size (comparable to chimpanzees?), which suggests predatory nature

T. rex teeth are unusual for a theropod -- large and deeply rooted, but not sharp or blade-like in shape
Serrated teeth may have trapped food particles which would then rot, making a T. rex bite septic (like Komodo dragons were thought to do)
But we now know that Komodo dragons use venom
While a septic bite is still possibly, the serrations strengthen the teeth to reduce breakage, allowing T. rex to power through flesh and bone
'Puncture-pull feeding'

Scanvenger or predator is not necessarily a dichotomy
Recent studies suggest at least a partially predatory lifestyle
Hadrosaur fossils show healed injuries from T. rex attacks and healed puncture wounds in skin impressions

If there are so many large theropod predators, why are they different?

Allosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus rex
Hunting styles: Allosaurus had blade like teeth and light weight skull with give ('hatchet-like attack'), and possibly a pack hunter
T. rex had spear-like teeth and a heavy weight skull with no give, and likely a solitary hunter relying on power of bite
T. rex had an immense bite, but still lower than Cretaceous crocodiles (and Megalodon)

Recent evidence suggests that the closest relatives of Tyrannosaurs (Albertosaurus) were pack hunters

Sue
Larson brothers in the Black Hills of South Dakota wanted to have their own museum, and became fossil-hunters
Black Hills Institute
Larson brothers found Sue, one of the most complete T. rex finds
Rumors began to grow that Sue was worth millions (though this wasn't realistic)
Legal dispute over whether Sue belong to the Larson brothers, the landowner, or the Cheyenne River Reservation
Led to Sue being taken into 'custody'; court case decided in favor of the landowner
Original interpretations of Sue differ greatly from current understanding
Sue's greatest legacy is the impact on dinosaur studies; politics, legal restrictions, and fees just to excavate on people's land
Universities and museums don't usually have the budget to do that -- curtailed dinosaur exploration except on public land

Stan is an even bigger T. rex than Sue, and sold for $32 million. Because of the cost of fossil hunting, it is being more and more restricted

Hunting styles:
Spinosaurus is over 15 meters long, bigger than T. rex
Many of the original Spinosaurus fossils were destroyed during World War II bombing
Sharp teeth, long head, look like crocodile teeth
Spinosaurus may have been almost completely fish-eating
No hint of calcified tendon in Spinosaurus tail, wide lateral processes
Tail would've been flexible, possibly useful for swimming
The sail may have been used similarly to a sailfish, herding fish

Baryonyx may have been a possible quadruped, similar to grizzly bears
Spinosaurus may have been almost fully aquatic

Invasive Species

Permian extinction was biggest mass extinction in Earth's history
Massive volcanic eruption starting in Siberian Traps
Acid rain, acidification of oceans killed plants on land and sea
Volcanism caused Carboniferous coal beds to ignite, releasing over 3 trillion tons of CO2 and methane and raising temperature by 8C
Since coal is not clean-burning, tremendous amounts of sulfur were also released

It was not just volcanism but Pangea itself that made the Permian extinction so deadly
Single supercontinent = global terrestrial community, decreased global diversity, increased vulnerability to high-stress event
Modeling suggests that a supercontinent could only support 2/3 of modern mammal species and 1/2 the number of bird species
We're recreating a global terrestrial community via human transportation and invasive species, which means decreased biodiversity

Although there were a few rabbits that came to Australia on the "First Fleet," it wasn't a problem until 1859
Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits on his estate for hunting purposes
Within 10 years of their introduction, 2 million rabbits were shot every year without any effect on rabbit population
Led to loss of crop and grass cover, increasing soil erosion and killing lots of native plants and animals
1901 - 1907: 'rabbit-proof' fence
Encouraging hunting and poisoning efforts had little success
Austin was a member of the Acclimatization Society of Victoria -- goal was the deliberate introduction of non-native species thought to be useful or picturesque

1890: Eugene Schieffelin released 60 European starlings in Central Park, and 40 the next year
These birds should've died in morning snow and sleet, but they found refuge in the eaves of the American Museum of Natural History and survived the winter
Starlings are better than other birds at finding insects in colder climates, and that means they don't have to migrate in the winter
They can find the best nesting sites because they don't have to leave in the winter
200 million European starlings in North America, 1/3 of the birds' global population
Range from Alaska to Northern Mexico

38 years earlier, Schieffelin had successfully introduced the house sparrow to control the ravages of the linden moth
At one point, there were 500 million sparrows in North America (now down to 75 million due to habitat destruction)

Other invasive species are so well-adapted that we don't think of them as invaders
Dandelions (native of Eurasia, brought on the Mayflower), ring-necked pheasants (native of China)
Non-native vs. invasive can be a matter of perspective

Of the 182 types of earthworms found in the U.S. and Canada, nearly a third are invasive species
In Minnesota, all earthworms are invasive species
Worms break up compact soil to allow air and water to move through soil and increase cycling of nutrients
But this is why they're so bad for forests
Recent ice sheets wiped out earthworms across Northern North America
Northern boreal forest evolved in completely earthworm-free conditions, and were characterized by a thick layer of decaying organic matter
Other plants began to rely on that organic matter, and animals on those plants
Earthworms can break down this matter
The understory and diversity is lost as earthworms become abundant
Break down surface organics and move nutriends down into deeper soil, out of reach of native plant species
Invasive species that can tolerate low-nutrient conditions then move in, but there aren't many of them, lowering overall biodiversity

Why can invasive species be so successful?

Enemy release -- introduced species leave rivals or predators behind
Purple loosestrife (from Eurasia), introduced to east coast of North America accidentally through sand ballast of ships
Spread along roads, canals, and ditches, and later introduced as an ornamental plant
A single plant can produce millions of seeds annually, forming really dense strands that reduce water flow
Makes wetlands unsuitable for a wide range of wetland animals and replaces many native plants
In Eurasia, a number of insects kept loosestrife in check. Without them, loosestrife exploded across the landscape

Naive species -- ones that have no experience or defense against invasive species
Brown tree snake (from Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea), introduced to Guam as a hitchhiker on a cargo flight
Before its arrival, Guam had no large snakes and no arboreal ones that would be near bird nests
9 of the 11 species of native forest-dwelling birds have been driven out of Guam
It has also wiped out 2 of 3 native bat species that have a role in pollination

Novel interactions -- sometimes the invaders are pathogens. A new disease is introduced that native species have no immunity against
American chestnut tree (4 billion trees to nearly extinct in 1916)
They were the 'redwoods' of the Appalachian mountains, up to 30m tall and 3m across with edible nuts that could be ground for flour or roasted
Chinese chestnuts brought to U.S. were resistant to a certain fungus that they were attached to, as they had co-evolved with the fungus
American chestnuts had no immunity to the fungus
Saplings can sprout from old roots, so American chestnuts still grow, but they grow with the blight and never grow large enough to flower and seed
Functionally extinct because it can't reproduce anymore

Most introduced species fail to take hold -- only 5% to 15% survive, and only 1% spread
That 1% can have huge impacts, and the number of yearly encounters is huge
Estimated 10,000 species are moved about the world in water ballast alone
Before humans arrived, Hawai'i gained a new species every 10,000 years
Now, it gets about one every month

Giant African snail (introduced to Hawai'i in 1936 as pets for schools)
But during the summer, many teachers would let the snails out in the wild in order to not have to take care of them
Once at large, it damaged crops
So they brought in a rosy wolf snail, a predator of the giant African snail, in order to attempt to control the population
But the wolf snail found it easier to eat smaller, native snails -- 90% of Hawai'i's native snails are extinct

Most successful invasive species are humans, domestic pets, and domestic crops
Many species adapted to humans, like coyotes and turkey vultures
Remixing of world's flora and fauna began with early human migration, but has accelerated dramatically
Decreased biodiversity combined with climate change

Between 1947 and 1956, 6.5 million coyotes were killed in the U.S. and we currently kill 500,000 a year
"War with coyotes"
Coyotes were originally found in the western prairies, but now extend across the continent
Coyotes evolved alongside larger wolves -- predators, but not apex predators
Coyotes had to become highly intelligent and remarkably wary because if it wasn't careful, it might get killed and eaten by wolves

Despite the 'lone wolf' reputation, wolves are almost exclusively pack animals which is why they were easier to kill
Unlike wolves, coyotes evolved fission-fusion societies. Social packs come and go depending on what's necessary
Elephants, chimpanzees, and humans also have fission-fusion societies
In response to population density, coyotes can alter their litter size from 2 to as many as 19
Coyotes are unusual because they're socially monogamous (only 3-5% of mammals are) and sexually monogamous (even fewer mammals are)

Virtually every large American city had coyotes by the year 2000
125 years ago, packs of wild or nearly wild dogs roamed American cities which kept coyotes at bay
In first few months of 1848, ten people died of rabies -- Great Dog War
Cruelty against dogs is where the ASPCA comes from, but eventually the stray dog packs were removed from cities
Coyotes do better in urban environments than in rural environments
First we created an ecosystem, and then freed up a niche, providing a refuge for an invasive animal already adapted to coping with alpha predators

Sauropoda: 'lizard foot'
Marsh believed that sauropods lived mostly in the water because of their size
During Cretaceous, sauropods are the dominant land animals in the Southern continents
Went extinct in North America during the Jurassic

Antarctica is the only continent with known sauropod fossils, but it does have Glacialisaurus, a basal sauropodomorpha similar to Massospondylus
During the Cretaceous, Antarctica had a climate similar to Oregon or Washington today
Largest known land animals -- greatest number of adaptations to reduce weight yet maintain support
Some sauropod tracks are 1.7m wide, suggesting its height is 5.5m at the hip

Immense size minimizes range of innovation possible
Relatively small skulls and brains
Erect elephant-like limbs without marrow cavities

Sauropods had huge areas for digestion along with saurischian-style hips
Despite their size, sauropods still laid eggs in nests
Some repeatedly used the same communal nesting sites (site fidelity)
Eggs tend to be spherical and aren't immense
Have porous, thick shells (protection and breathing)
Remnants of vegetation often found in nests (to incubate eggs, as animals were too large to brood)
At one Argentina site, sauropods relied on geothermal springs for nesting incubation

Some species apparently raised young in nests for at least some time
Tracks showed that young traveled with adults for some time
Brontomerus ('thunder thighs') had unusaully heavy thighs that might have been for defense

Not all sauropods shared the same herd structures
For example, high browsers would have herds of juvenile sauropods moving by themselves because they can't access the same food as adults
Growth rates remain uncertain -- current bone studies suggest that 90% of growth occurs in first 10 years of life

Unlike theoropods, sauropods show little evidence of injuries or health issues apart from some fusion of vertebrae and calcification of cartilage
When you're really big, any injury is likely to be life-threatening. So any injured sauropod would not have survived long enough to heal

Although being big improves your chances of making it into the fossil record
Being too big makes it less likely that your fossils are collected and studied
Time and expense involved means that sauropods are less well studied
Can do dozens of small dinosaur digs in the same time it takes to do one sauropod dug
Complete finds are rare as it is difficult to bury such a big animal

Argentinosaurus
Titanosaurus at AmNatHistMuseum -- 37 metters long, 63.5 metric tons, too heavy to even mount so they needed 3D printed mount
But this is still a juvenile specimen
Europasaurus -- lived on an island, so was pretty small (only 6 meters long). But it was still the biggest animal in its ecosystem

Estimates of weight are notoriously poor
Increasing size creates some interesting effects
As animal increases size, compressive strength of bone quickly becomes a limiting factor
Two crucial problems with increasing size -- weight bearing and shedding heat
Getting enough food is not typically an issue -- it may be the driving force behind being big
Bigger size means access to food that others can't eat

Load-bearing adaptations
Robust limb bones -- thicker proportional to size (and stress)
Vertical limb designs with few angles
Weight-breaing hands and feet with near-unguligrade (tiptoe design)
Why retain claws? We used to think they were there to avoid slipping in mud, but this is probably wrong
Our best guess right now is that claws were used to dig nests
In some forms, the hands become much more elaborately designed than the feet do
Back feet have big, circular heel pads, front feet have more of an arc from the toes
Titanosaur hands lacked claws and digits -- it walked on its metatarsals
Four fused sacral vertebrae in order to support hips more

Load-lightening applications
Small, light slender skulls
One of two basic plans: elongated skulls with simple peg-like teeth, designed for raking vegetation in at front of mouth
Or rounded skulls with shearing teeth
Sauropods did not chew their food
Camarasaurus replaced tooth every 62 days, Diplodocus every 35 days, Nigersaurus every 14 days
Eating tough, fibrous land plants

Simple ball and socket articulation where skull attaches to the neck means skulls are easily lost
Sculpted vertebrae and pneumatic (hollow) bones especially in the neck
Same avian flow-through respiratory system
Don't lie down

Problems with big size
Heat loss and blood pressure are problems for large animals
Necks can be up to over 15m, 6x longest giraffe neck
Giraffes' tight skin is an adapatation to help maintain high blood pressure to head
Giraffes get most of their water from the food they eat because bending over to drink water is dangerous
Getting food is the driving force behind large size rather than a problem resulting from it

1m: lots of theropods and some very selective herbivores (ones that just eat seeds for example)
6-9m: Some theropods but lots of herbivores (stegosaurs, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, ankylosaurs)
9-15m: a few theropods, but mostly larger ornithopods and smaller sauropods
15m: only sauropods

25,000 years ago, the white-tailed deer was the 29th largest North American mammal. Now it's the 9th
Humans have killed many large animals
Paraceratherium (extinct rhino) was the largest terrestrial mammal -- as tall as a giraffe and stocky, but only the size of the smaller sauropods
Might be the largest land mammal possible due to mammal-size respiration
