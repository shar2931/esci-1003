Benefits of Being Big

Protection -- modern predators usually only prey on smaller animals (up to a maximum of a few times their size)
Resources -- big animals can feed on low nutrient plants or different plants
ecological separation from competing species
pound-per-pound, large animals can use resources more efficiently than small ones

Elephant vs. Shrew
roughly same body temperature, but elephant heart beats 20-30 times/min vs. 1200/min for shrew
in relation to its size, shrew's heart is 3x size of race horse
elephant eats 295 kg of food per day (4% of body weight)
shrew weighs 3 grams, but needs 4 grams of food per day
shrew eats animal tissue (insects) so it has much higher nutrition value than elephant food

Paraceratherium (34-23 MYA): extinct giant rhino, probably the biggest land mammal ever

Earliest sauropods similar to basal sauropodomorphs ('prosauropods')
Generally tend to be larger -- obligatory quadrupeds, compared to basal sauropodomorphs which could be bipedal even in adult form
Basal sauropods were short-necked, generally unspecialized forms
Followed by neosauropodeans, of which there were two main clades

Dipolodocids (ex. Diplodocus, up to 30m long)
Long neck (15 vertebrae)
Pronounced cleft in vertebrae which held a large ligament running from the neck down to the tail (used for support)
Older idea of horizontal neck is probably incorrect, but it could bend its neck down for feeding
Long slender skull, with simple peg-like teeth at front of jaw to rake vegetation in
Nasal opening at top of skull
Variations do occur such as Nigersaurus, which was a low browser, and Brachytrachelopan, which had a short neck
Brontosaurus ('thunder lizard') so named by Marsh due to his respect for Lakota traditions ('thunder-beast', 'thunder-bird')
Confusion over its lost skull (Camarasaurus skull put on Brontosaurus body) led to the Brontosaurus name being dismissed and the animal called Apatosaurus
Now, Brontosaurus is back to being its own name (part of Apatosaurus clade)

Macronarians (ex. Camarasaurus, although alternate schemes exist)
Shorter neck (12 vertebrae)
Shorter tail (only 56 vertebrae)
Rounded skull with large openings, spoon-shaped teeth for slicing off vegetation
Brachiosaurus -- forelimbs longer than rear limbs
Neck vertebrae without cleft and short tail (longer arms mean that counter-balance from tail isn't needed as much, weight and neck balanced on forelimbs)
Stance similar to modern giraffes

Titanosaurs (most in Cretaceous, mostly in Southern continents)
Alamosaurus made it into N. America just before end of Cretaceous
Sauroposeidon may have been 18m tall (60 feet)
Dreadnaughtus was 26m long and weighted 60 metric tons
Titanosaur hands not only lacked claws but digits as well -- walked on metatarsals
Some titanosaurs like Saltasaurus added osteoderms to the mix of sauropod features
Not for armor, but instead where they may have been storing the calcium which went into egg shells

Although all sauropods shared a similar plan, their variations were important
Differentiation of resources allowed different lines to co-exist

Dipolodocus vs. Camarasaurus
Dipolodocus
each tooth had 5 developing replacement teeth, each tooth replaced every month, heavy wear pattern suggests grit mixed in with plant food
suggests low-browsing behavior

Camarasaurus
larger teeth, 3 replacement teeth, teeth replaced every two months, light wear pattern suggests little grit
suggests high-browsing behavior

Nigersaurus, one of the sauropods most adapted for low-browsing, had 9 replacement teeth
Low-browsing sauropods could graze a big area without moving their body

Dipolodocids may have been able to rear up because they balanced on their rear legs
Highly unlikely that brachiosaurus and titanosaurs could do this

Some sauropods (low browsers?) traveled in mixed-age herds
Others (high browsers?) traveled in age-specific herds; niche-partitioning within age groups of the same species

Impacts on the environment -- elephants vs. sauropods
Elephants are good diggers, can dig for groundwater or salt deposits; Other animals rely on the elephants for these resources
Sauropod feet have claws and we know they dug nests, so they may have also done this

Savannah landscape is largely maintained by elephants and other herd animals
Feed on tree saplings and shrubs, helping to keep the plains open as grazing habitats for other grassland species
Without grazing, savannah would become scrublands and then woodlands
Sauropods would have had the same impact on their environment

Elephants create gaps in dense woodlands that lead to the growth of other plants, which in turn provide food for other species and pathways for other animals
Sauropods would have done the same -- big size means they would have disturbed habitats

Elephants feeding on high trees dislodge seeds that are valuable food sources for other animals
Sauropods would have done the same

Elephants are the most effective seed distributor in African forests
They eat and disperse so many intact seeds, and can carry them to such great distances (tens of kilometers vs. meters for other seed eaters)
Only animals that are large enough to dispere some big seeds
Sauropods would be doing the same thing
They must have been long-distance migrators because of they stayed in one place, they would quickly run out of resources
Oxygen isotope ratios of enamel layers in Camarasaurus teeth show that herds migrated at least 300km between basin and highland areas

Most of the seeds dispersed by elephants are deposited in dung, a really rich fertilizer because elephants only digest 50% of what they eat
Elephant dung is important for maintaining nutrient-rich soils and is a food source and habitat for other animals (insects and insect eaters)
Would've been no different for sauropods

While the basal sauropodomorphs were the first high browsers capable of transforming terrestrial ecosystems, sauropod herds took this even farther
First large-animal herds, first long distance migrations, and first efficient large seed transporters -- all due to large size

Due to large size, people originally assumed that sauropods were aquatic
Water pressure would likely prevent an aquatic lifestyle -- ribs couldn't expand 30 feet under water

Roland Thaxter Bird did a lot of work with dinosaur trackways, and he was the one who realized that they travel in herds and they were terrestrial
Were sauropods really warm-blooded? 
Elephants spend up to 75% of their day eating, so how could a larger animal survive?
Rapid growth rates suggests a non-ectothermic physiology
Paraceratherium was the same size as some sauropods and it was warm-blooded

Dinosaur National Monument was founded by Louisa Carnegie
Andrew Carnegie wanted to find the biggest dinosaur for his wife Louisa
Apatosaurus louisia and Diplodocus carnegii named for them

Stegosaurs
Part of Thyreophora (along with ankylosaurs)
Scales -> Scutes -> Osteoderms
Osteoderms can be used for armor, but they're also used for structure (like in crocodiles where muscle attaches to them)
Osteoderms are highly vascularized; for crocodiles, they also help to neutralize acidification of body fluids due to being underwater for long periods of time

For stegosaurs, osteoderms are used for armor, display, and social competition
Size, speed, and herds are big defenses against predators
Thyreophores also have weapons for defense
Tail weapons were unusual (although some sauropods like Shunosaurus had a tail club)
Hylaeosaurus, found by Gideon Mantell, was the third dinosaur to be recognized
Thyreophora was the first subdivision of Owen's Dinosauria
Underside of stegosaurs' necks have osteoderms

All Thyreophora tend to be squat forms with short legs relative to the body
Nearly all were obligate quadrupeds; however, body design reflects traces of bipedal ancestry
Back legs are much longer than the front legs, and they have long tails

Stegosauria
Many older texts refer to stegosaur extinction at end of Jurassic, but this is only true in N. America
First stegosaurs described are from the Early Cretaceous
Few were well documented until recently
Huayangosaurus (Middle Jurassic) is the earliest-known stegosaur; half of known stegosaurs are from China

Huayangosaurus vs. Stegosaurus
Shorter skull vs. slender long skull
Premaxillary teeth in upper jaw vs. development of beak
Forelimbs same size as rear vs. forelimbs shorter than rear
Rear limbs could run vs. rear limbs not designed for running
Tail had some ossified tendons vs. tail completely flexible, hip bones flatter, front of pubic bone extended
4.5m long vs. 9m long

Huayangosaurus still has some ancestral traits (osteoderms and a tail club)
It had plates and spikes running down its back and a thagomizer
Stegosaurus tail nearly horizontal
Non-bilateral symmetry is rare in animals
No evidence of herding (bonebeds or tracks)

Allosaurus caudal vertebrae with spike-shaped hole and Stegosaurus neck plate with U-shaped hole that fits Allosaurus jaw
10% of tail spike tips are broken
Skull has recessed area for cheek-equivalent structures -- some processing of food within mouth
Mouth also has a hard palate

Stegosaurus is the namesake but not the most typical Stegosaur
Doesn't have the typical shoulder spikes, and it has unpaired plates
Stegosaur decline could be linked to competition from ankylosaurs or extinction of cycad plants

Fossil record is better during periods of high sea level -- more deposition
Soil erosion affects plants which affects the whole fossil record
Also affects stream flow, groundwater levels, and temperature of water systems (bare ground is more easily heated)
Right now, we are in a period of relatively high sea level
Despite this, soil erosion is reaching record rates (unnatural)
Deforestation -- forests and plants cover and stabilize land surfaces, allowing rest of plant communities to thrive
This leads to more flooding and sediment being washed out to sea, which increases coastal wetlands (which comes at expense of interior ecosystems)

Battle of Thermopylae site under 20 meters of sediment which extends 5km to the sea
Wind desiccation -- without trees, wind causes springs, streams, and wells to run dry
Deforestation generally starts along rivers because it's easier to move logs that way -- fragmentation of forests maximizes impacts on biodiversity
Once Greek forests were gone, goat herding prevented their return because goats could survive on a largely denuded landscape
Deforestation of mountain slopes can lead to increased soil loss and runoff -- lower groundwater table
Deforestation of low lying areas can lead to increased transpiration -- higher groundwater table

First major flood of the Tiber was noted in 241 BCE, and records indicate increased flooding from that time onward
With wetlands and floods came mosquitos and malaria
Few forests were left in Mediterranean area after Roman expansion, and much of its former top-soil now lies on the seafloor
20x increase in soil erosion in 3rd century; harbors and ports filled while coastlines were pushed out into sea

Ankylosauria -- other half of Thyreophora
Scelidosaurus is the closest thing we have to an ancestral form of both stegosauria and ankylosauria
Scelidosaurus had extensive armor and layers of added skull bone similar to Ankylosaurus (but skull and hips similar to Stegosaurus)

Ankylosauria
Arose in Early Jurassic (until 2022, thought to be Middle Jurassic) in China
Suggests a rapid diversification because they quickly spread to N. America
Last few back vertebrae and sacral vertebrae fused to hip
Huge horizontal ilium for powerful leg and tail muscles
Short limbs to carry weight or armored body and brings unarmored belly close to ground
Hands fulled adapted for weight-bearing
Body armor consists of large osteoderms embedded in flesh, with smaller ones in between (gravel to pea-sized)
Osteoderms are seldom preserved in place, so their pattern and distribution is uncertain
Design of body plating still allows for flexibility and movement

Pangolin -- despite being heavily armored, it can curl into a tight ball
Works well with pangolins' natural predators
Ankylosaurs are sort of a scaled-up pangolin with spikes
As body flexed, spikes along sides may have had scissor-motion that would deter predators (like getting a hand caught in gears)

Nodosaurs are one group of ankylosauria
Like stegosaurus, teeth are small and simple
Deeply inset to give space for cheek-equivalent structures
Large throat bones suggest long mobile tongues
Like stegosaurs, hard palate separated nasal and mouth cavities (can chew and breathe at same time)
Borealopelta markmitchelli -- Nodosaur found in oil sands mine in Alberta
Nodosaur head less armored and contains fewer large scutes
More extensive body armor, lateral spikes common, tail consists of up to 40 vertebrae, no tail club

Ankylosaurs are the other group
Lateral spikes less common, clubbed tail with roughly 20 vertebrae (not a thagomizer)
Reinforced tail at the end, flexible at the hip with wide lateral processes
Flexible armor in bands (more aggressive defense?)

Big weakness for theropods is that they only have 2 legs to walk on -- particularly vulnerable to leg injuries
These tail clubs are very good at hitting legs
Like stegosaurs, no evidence of herding (probably individuals or small family groups)
The only exception is a dozen juvenile ankylosaurs found together (Pinacosaurus)

Nodosaurs have narrow muzzles, ankylosaurs broad (similar to white (wide) vs. black rhinos)
Nodosaurs had large, forward facing nasal passages
Ankylosaurs had side facing nares with some of the most cmoplex nasal passages of any dinosaur group

There are very few animals with weaponized tails

Marginocephalians (Ceratopsians and Pachycephalosaurs); part of Cerapoda (Marginocephalians and Ornithopods)
Arose in Eurasia
Both characterized by enlarged posterior 'margin' of skull
In Pachycephalosaurs, top of skull thickened
In Certopsians, margin enlarged into frill
Features originally interpreted as defense, but now considered part of social display

Pachycephalosaurs range from very small forms up to 4.5m long Pachycephalosaurus
Dominantly Late Cretaceous, exclusively in the northern continents (which at this point are completely separate from the southern continents)
Originally thought to have arisen in eastern Eurasia, but now the most basal members of the group seem to be from N. America
Used to be divided into 'flat-heads' (Homocephaloidea) and 'dome-heads' (Pachycephaloidea)
But recent work suggests that most flat-heads were juvenile forms of dome-heads
Dracorex
Despite their enlarged heads, they have relatively small brains (poor taphonomy for these animals in general)
Large eyes and optic nerve, unusually large olfactory lobes (good eyesight and smell)
No beak on top, still has canines in front; row of small inset cheek teeth crowned by ridges
Recessed areas along jaw and differences in tooth shape suggest some processing of food in mouth
Bulky torso with expanded gut area and broad hips
Short forelimbs, long legs, short thick neck, and long tail; really strong hip
Low browser, but didn't eat anything particularly tough
No preserved tracks found, and not very many feet found either
Low number of finds may reflect population or taphonomy (possibly mountain-dwelling)
But describing them as mountain-dwelling may simply be due to early analogy with bighorn sheep, without any real evidence beyond that
Modifications of skulls, neck joint, and back vertebrae might have allowed skull to be used as weapon or in intra-species competition
Only dinosaur group to have neck opening at botttom of skull
Many animals today that lock horns have curved horns or ornamentation to lessen stresses
Pachycephalosaurs had no protection on the skull -- why would they have headbutted if its likely that one of them dies?
Most egg-laying animals do not have harems
Pachycephalosaur skulls may have been used for flank-butting, not head-butting (safer for both animals)
Would fit with wide stance and large hips
Could have also been used for grinding contents (like bison)
>20% of domed skulls have lesions that look like infections from traumatic skin injuries
Also supports the idea that flat-heads are juvenile dome-head
Stygimoloch


Early Ceratopsian: Yinlong (found in China)
Relatively small dinosaur (about the size of a small dog)
Despite the lack of frills, horns, or a beak, Yinlong was a ceratopsian
Deep wide skull for its body size and rostal bone
Has some pachycephalosaur traits, but it is a basal ceratopsian
