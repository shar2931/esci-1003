Middle Triassic World
Early mammals and early dinos arise at the same time

In the Jurassic, Pangea starts breaking up, but many connections remain and even breaks are all fairly recent
Faster plate motion -> warmer climate
Global dinosaur community -- any group that arises can spread across the whole world
By late Jurassic, northern continent and southern continent separated but internally connected
Stegosaurs found all across the world

Cretaceous (145 MYA - 65 MYA)
Final breakup of Pangea (with exception of South America and Antarctica)
Increased diversity of land community due to separation of continental masses
For example, horned certopsians only arose in North America
Late Cretaceous (90 MYA) -- high sea levels because of rapid sea floor spreading, which occurs ~100 MY after supercontinental breakup
Up to 1/3 of present land area submerged
In North America, seaway covers western MN to eastern Rockies

1. higher sea level means warmer Earth because water more easily absorbs solar radiation than land
	Greenhouse Earth; no evidence of glaciation anywhere, only 20C difference from pole to equator
	plants and reefs found 15 degrees poleward of present positions
	tropical zone extends to 45 degrees N/S
2. pattern of ocean current transported more heat to poles
	Geography, ocean and atmosphere circulation also part of the picture
	plate tectonics can affect global climate by affecting ocean current circulation
	ocean currents and their overlying moist air transfers heat through the climate system
	about 3 MYA, isthmus of Panama formed and N/S America connected
	this created North Atlantic current, and also triggered an Ice Age
	Tethys Sea
	nowadays, Antarctica is isolated by a cold current ring but this was only recently formed
	in Mesozoic, Antarctica was completely ice-free
3. higher CO2 from more volcanism
	increased CO2 leads to more greenhouse warming but also more O2

By late Cretaceous, continents have moved far enough apart to form new connections
Sauropods had been extinct in N.A. from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous
But by the very late Cretaceous, some sauropods travel to N.A. from S.A. and some hadrosaurs make the reverse journey

Fossils are any evidence of past life
By necessity, we must interpret fossils from a very incomplete data set
Body fossils are any remains of an organism (including casts and impressions)
Trace fossils are any other evidence of past life (tracks, trails, burrows, eggs, nests, coprolites)
Trace fossils represent fossilized behavior

Earliest evidence of life?
Body fossils: found 3.5 BYA show remains of algal colonies
Trace fossils: 3.9 BYA, isotope ratios in carbon seams suggest photosynthesis

Plankton provides most oil/gasoline
Fossil record is not a faithful record of all organisms
Many parts of an organism are never preserved (brain, e.g.)
Many groups of organism are seldom to never preserved (jellyfish)
Many environments are seldom to never preserved (mountain ranges are subject to frequent erosion so sediment buildup doesn't occur)
Other environments are disproportionately represented (swamps)
Marine settings are generally better than land (unless you get too deep)

In modern North America, organisms on the Gulf and Atlantic coastal areas have the best chance of making it into the fossil record

Taphonomy (laws of burial) -- study of all processes that occur in an organism from the time it dies until it is found as a fossil
Attempts to understand what is and is not preserved
Classic idea of fossilization -- dinosaur dies, decays a little bit, and bones become preserved
This is very rare

Fossilization process:
Death, decay/scavenging, transport, burial, lithification, uplift/exposure, discovery (?)
At every step of this process, information loss can occur
Preventing information loss

If you want to be a fossil:
1. Have lots of hard parts
2. Be big (but not too big so that there's enough sediment to bury you)
3. Be buried rapidly to prevent scavenging
4. Die near an anoxic setting to limit aerobic bacteria (lagoon, swamp)
	Berlin archeopteryx and Chinese dinosaurs, both with feathers preserved, were both found in lagoons
5. Where you live matters and how you die matters (predation, parasites/disease, dehydration or drowning, accidents, age)
	Coelophysis -- many of these small predators found near an ancient river system in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico
	Many people thought that they might be social hunters which is why they were near a river
	When bones of smaller ones were found in bigger ones, interpretation shifted to cannibalism
	Ray Rodgers of Macalaster realized that these river beds were the last vestiges of water left during a drought
	What looked like cannibalism was simply ones bones falling on top of another after death
6. What happens after you die matters
	Scavenging (large like hyenas and vultures, small like beetles, microscopic like bacteria)
	Beetles are used to clean bones before they are displayed
	2 million deer in MN & WI, all males shed antlers annually, ice retreated from area 10,000 years ago
	Mice and other rodents eat deer antlers to get calcium

Taphonomy and Zombie Apocalypse
Even after death, the skin does a pretty good job of keeping things out of the body
Within 48 hours, zombies can't see, hear, or smell [due to maggots and other parasites entering body orifices]

Sequence of information loss
Softest tissue (organs and skin) decompose first
Tendons and ligaments go next
Bones (or shells) follow
Teeth are last

Dinosaur teeth are useful, but not as useful as mammal teeth
Their teeth are denser and harder so they do survive
Continual tooth replacement means there are lots of dino teeth
But because they're continually replaced, they're not as specialized
So they're not diagnostic of species or genera in the same way mammal teeth are

Losses can be reduced in stressed environments (low biological activity)
Tollund Man (2300 years old) was found in a bog in Denmark, super well-preserved
Arid environments (like Taklamakan Desert) also make good environments for well-preserved mummies
Egypt's mummies owe more to their environment than human preparation
Cold conditions: La Doncella in Andes, Otzi (5300 years old) in the Alps

Taphonomy in communities is even more complicated
Do the remains represent a single community or just one? (For example, many different animals visiting a water source)
Post-death transport can also make it seem like animals lived together when they didn't
Dinosaur National Monument appears to be the accumulation of remains at a river bend, rather than one community of dinos

What might be fossilized?
Trees: petrified wood, bark impressions, needles/pinecones, root casts, soil, sap (amber), pollen
	Of these, pollen is most likely to be fossilized

Birds: bones, feather impressions, tracks, feces, nests
	Of these, tracks are the most likely to be fossilized and guano is second most likely
	Bones are too hollow/light to fossilized and feathers have to have perfect conditions

Mice: bones, teeth, fur, tracks, feces, burrows, gnaw marks
	Of these, teeth and gnaw marks are most likely to fossilize
	Teeth are very strong

Humans: bones, teeth, hair impressions, tracks, feces
	Technology and tool trace fossils are most likely to be preserved in the fossil record

What's more likely to fossilize:
Bird vs. Cow: Cow would be more likely to leave a fossil record due to size and thick bones

Mountain goat vs. Orangutan: Orangutan is more likely to fossilized because mountain is eroding away, despite the bio activity in the jungle

Lion vs. Wildebeest: Lot more wildebeests than lions, so wildebeests are more likely to fossilize

Hippo vs. Rhino: Hippo lives in a river so it's more likely to fossilize

Bat vs. Mouse: Mouse is more likely to fossilize because the bat is flying and has hollow bones. Mouse bones are already on the ground

Earliest hominid ancestors vs. Gorillas and Chimpanzees: Hominids due to tool use

Early Triassic: Low sea level -> slow plate motion -> erosion dominates over deposition -> land fossil records are poor
Late Cretaceous: Fast plate motion, shallow inland seas, more deposition on land
Best fossil records tend to occur in rift valleys

Much of taphonomy involves loss of information, but is also a source of information
Teeth marks suggest diet and behavior -- spacing of teeth tracks on sauropod bones match Allosaurus teeth
Ammonite fossils found with holes match Mosasaur tooth marks

How deep was the Cretaceous seaway? A lot of people thought it was very shallow
As ammonites die, they sink into the water, and eventually the shells implode due to water pressure
Ammonite studies actually showed that the sea must have been thousands of meters deep at points

Post-Cretaceous small rodent radiation: early paleontologists thought there was an explosion of rodents after KT extinction
But others noticed that types of rodents hadn't increased, only number of rodents found
This suggested the evolution of owls, which eat rodents and enter them into the fossil record through owl pellets

Not everything in the fossil record is taphonomy, which is what happens after death
	Healed wounds, evidence of pathology of sickness
	Sue the T. rex had trichomoniasis parasite which caused holes in its jaw

Variety of dionsaur finds originally interpreted to be different genera were later interpreted as ontogeny (growth stages)
15 genera of triceratops just turned out to be 15 different stages in the life cycle
Some have even suggested that Triceratops is just a young version of Torosaurus

Sexual dimorphism can also give the appearance of different fossils
Dinosaurs also had sexual dimorphism but it's unclear which sex was larger

Dinosaurs were usually depicted as grey-green or green-gray (like elephants or rhinos)
Birds are more colorful than mammals, so were dinosaurs also like that?
2008: fossilized melanosomes found in feathers (like iridescent black of ravens and crows)
Evidence suggests that feathered dinosaurs had some color
Even non-feathered dinosaurs may have had color

History is biased towards cultures with written records and are usually not objective

China-Mongolia border: statue of two dinosaurs kissing
Elephants prefer to have sex in the water because it provides more buoyancy and less risk of falling
But elephants have almost insignificant tails
Early paleontologists noted common healed sacral vertebrae fractures, which they thought was related to dinosaur sex
Beverly Halstead: Was fascinated by the topic and even wrote children's books on the topic

But what about dinosaur courtship?
Birds today have elaborate courtship dances
Recent evidence suggests that dinosaurs also behaved similarly (dinosaur tracks scratched in the ground)

Coal

Peat -> Lignite -> Bitiminous -> Anthracite

"Coal is portable climate" - Emerson
Coal and the Carboniferous are linked
Pangea starts coming together during the Carboniferous
Significant part of proto Pangea lies near South Pole so there's an Ice Age
Only about 5 major ice ages in Earth's existence (most recent one started 3 MYA and is ongoing)
Sea level changes due to glacial cycles are much faster than those due to plate tectonics (thousands vs. millions of years)
Upper Carboniferous Ice Age led to alternating shallow and deep deposits are stacked atop one another in the same area

These deposits have iron ore, coal, and carbonate -- what you need for an Industrial Revolution
Coal can be used to melt iron ore, carbonate acts as a flux to pull impurities out from melted iron
Minnesota has tons of iron ore in the north and limestone in the south, but no coal and no way to bring the iron and limestone together in the Pre-Industrial world
Great Britain had lots of these Upper Carboniferous deposits
In the U.S., the upper Carboniferous is called the 'Pennsylvanian' because that's where the deposits were found -- that's why Pennsylvania was linked to steel
One industrialized, nations could take advantage of other coal deposits (Cretaceous coal, etc.)
But cyclic layered Upper Carboniferous deposits were crucial to get industralization started in G.B.

Catholic Church held most of richest coal mines and only accepted short-term leases (surface mining)
Deeper mines required expensive drainage systems because water would seep in
When Henry VIII broke with the Church, he sold the land to private citizens which greatly expanded coal mining
Henry VIII built the first English fleet, but Elizabeth I built the first English navy
Big warships needed crews with lots of expertise
Early coal ships were the largest English merchant ships; these served as the 'nursery' for the British navy
Coal ship crews were the only ones with experience sailing large vessels, so they were critical for the navy

1306: Edward I, public protests against coal use led to it being banned (due to smell, etc.)
As population grew and forests were cut down, deforestation became driving force behind coal
1603: Elizabeth I dies, coal was the main fuel source for the country
1700: Britain is mining 5x more coal than the rest of the world combined

Deeper coal mines needed water drainage systems
Early on, water wheels and human/animal labor were used to power these drainage systems
1712: Thomas Newcomen invented first stearm engine
But it needed so much coal that the only place it was practical to use was in coal mines
1776: James Watt revised steam engine (Bloomfield Coal Fields in Tipton)
Coal brought to surface by human or horse power, but eventually they started using rails
First Stephenson locomotive was built to transport coal to surface
Steam engines and railroads both come directly from coal mines

Reliance on waterpower previously kept most industries in rural areas (they had to be where waterfalls were)
Coal-powered steam engines allowed industries to consolidate into urban areas
1848: Britain producing more iron than rest of world combined
Great Exhibit of 1851: Crystal Palace and Dinosaurs
Waterhouse Hawkins also recreated the coal strata at the Crystal Palace exhibit because of their importance to Britain
I.R. turned London from a village to a massive city

All early gas lighting wasn't natural gas, but coal gas
Coal was not a clean-burning fuel
In order to maintain a draft, coal chimneys had to be narrower than wood chimneys
They had to use kids to clean chimneys (under the age of 9)
Children worked in coal mines from early on (small spaces)
1920: Child labor in coal mines banned in U.S.
Average starting age for a coal miner was 8
Average life expectancy was 24 (compared to U.S. average of 49)

Because of soot, wealthy homes stopped having tapestries on their walls and they had woodwork instead
Difficulty of keeping clothes clean accentuated class differences
Also the reason black became the standard color for umbrellas and formal wear
Westerly winds led to wealthy living in western suburbs, and why East End of London was the poorest part of London

As early as 1661, people began to warn of coal's impact on public health
Estimated 1/4 of all London deaths were lung-related, and 1/3 of those occurred under the age of 5
During Crimean War, 42% of urban poor of London were unfit for military duty (compared to 17% of rural poor)
Lack of sunlight due to coal smoke, narrow streets, and lack of open spaces led to rickets becoming known as the 'English Disease'
Some neighborhoods had 100% of children of affected, and a 1918 government report said half the population was affected by rickets

Response was complicated by uncertainty over the main source of coal smoke: industry or domestic?
Chimneys (often multiple) rose from every dwelling
Folwell Hall has lots of chimneys, but most of them were decorative to make UMN look more productive
Industrial sources were easy to target but were economically powerful
'Thames above Waterloo Bridge' by J. M. W. Turner shows coal fog in London

Britain had bituminous coal vs. anthracite coal (cleanest burning, takes longest to form)
Coal hearth was center of British home
1880: 3.5 million fireplaces in London
London's 'fog' was mostly coal smoke pollution
In Bleak House, after Dickens mentions the Megalosaurus, he mentions the coal smoke
1676: Hooke estimated smoke over London to be 1/2 mile high and 20 miles wide
1840s: Newspapers complied list of deaths and accidents due to fog-related collisions of boats, vehicles, and people
Hundreds died from respiratory compliacations during particularly dense fog

Londoners embraced their fogs. Peaked in 1880s, cultural identified with Victorian London
Yellow haze comes from sulfur in bituminous coal ('pea-soupers')
Claude Monet: Houses of Parliament in the Fog (came to London specifically to paint the fog)
Yoshio Markino: 'Fog: Ladies Crossing Picadilly' (went to S.F. to paint fog, but it wasn't as consistent as London's)
Daubigny: 'St. Paul's from the Surrey Side'

Before refrigeration, Britain relied on split yellow peas so pea soup was yellow
In the meantime, coal began to lose its clout to other techonologies
Partially replaced by oil and natural gas
Rise of central heating -- natural gas and electricity used to heat water
Finally began to reduce domestic coal use
1938: Less than half of domestic energy was coal (but was concentrated in poorer houses)
1952: Really bad fog. Plays were canceled because audiences couldn't see actors on stage
	12,000 people died, and over 100,000 were taken ill
1940s: Pittsburgh was not far behind London's fogs
1956: London bans soft (bituminous) coal burning and fogs disappeared for good

All we've done is moved coal to rural electric generation
U.S. east coast visibility is often 14 miles
Without coal pollution, it would be 45 to 90 miles
In China, India, and even the U.S., coal is still a persistent issue
U.S. has 1/4 of the world's coal, but we've already used all the cleanest burning anthracite
`
Coal is behind acid rain and ocean acidification
Ice ages 300 million years ago are all deeply linked to modern society
Human activities have unforseen consequences
At first there's considerable uncertainty about the problem
Followed by resistance to proposed responses
And successful responses only occur once they are recognized as being in everyone's best interests (like 1952 London fog)
Finally, there's often an enduring legacy that is largely accepted or tolerated

Vertebrate Designs
Most vertebrate skeletons are more alike than different -- basically all the same design
Skeletons are more than bones -- combination of bone, teeth, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and muscles
Bones and teeth are the only ones with a relatively good fossil records, but sometimes we get lucky

Iguanadon tail tendons and ligaments were calcified and preserved
More commonly, the curvature of necks and tails give an indication of presence of tendons and ligaments
After death, ligaments and tendons contract and shorten
Spacing of bones can reflect cartilage, discs, or sternum

Skin and its derivatives (nails, feathers, hair, hooves, and horns) are seldom preserved directly except for rare impressions or carbonized films
Very well preserved Psittacosaurus and Nodosaurus
It's hard to predict what all these soft tissues and non-preserved features looked like when making an impression of what a fossil looked like
Cyclops legend might come from pygmy elephant / mammoth skulls found on an island

Bone is a combination of mineral and organic matter
70% by weight is calcium apatite, the rest is mostly collagen
Apatite gives bone its stiffness and strength, collagen gives it flexibility and elasticity
During taphonomy, collagen decays more rapidly than bone, and it becomes ages and becomes more brittle and porous
Bone is filled by blood channels, marrow, and living bone cells
After death, minerals from groundwater can fill pore spaces (perimineralization)

In some adult forms, growth stops (like humans)
We don't know if dinosaurs continually grew (like iguanas) or if they stopped growing at some point
Bone cells can still precipitate new material due to injury or stress (such as healing after a bone breaks)
Bone fusion of structural elements can greatly increase strength but at cost of mobility
Owen's classified dinosaurs was by their fused sacral vertebrae

Ceratopsians have 10-12 fused sacral vertebrae (even more than sauropods which were much bigger)
Ceratopsians were more active and may have wrestled or otherwise used their hips, meaning they needed more reinforcement
Birds have lots of bone fusion, strengthening skeleton while allowing hollow bones to minimize weight

All vertebrate skeletons share the same basic design
Same bones, just different shapes and sizes because of different lifestyles

Human feet are big and floppy with small ankles, which aren't really designed for running
Human hip has to be narrow because humans are bipedal (also very strong and rigid)
This means that childbirth can be deadly for humans (combined with selection pressure for larger heads)
Humans are the only animals that face a significant chance of death during childbirth
Curved spine also supports bipedalism
Skull being on top of the spine is also unusual -- most animals have the spine join the back of the skull
Human eyesight is better than most other animal eyesight, but hearing and sense of smell are worse
This is probably because our ancestors were arboreal and needed to judge the distance to the next tree or branch
Hands and arms are designed for manipulating objects

Design is often a compromise between different requirements
Vertebral column is the main support of the body
But also needs to be mobile and can't be too heavy
Vertebrae are often sculpted to maximize strength and minimize weight (neural arch for nerve protection)

Fish never had to worry about fighting gravity, so their vertebrae are just solid disks to provide as much strength as possible
Whales had land ancestors, so their vertebrae are very different than fish because they once had to worry about minimizing weight

Sauropod vertebrae (necks) had lots of gas-filled pleurosils to help support and keep the neck up
All sauropod bones besides the limbs were hollow L
Limb bones are often 'pipe-like' to lighten load while maintaining strength
Pipes are harder to bend than solid rods
Size can override this -- Sauropod legs lack marrow cavities because they had to support such a massive weight

Mammals and dinosaurs arose at the same time, so why did dinosaurs dominate?
Earliest dinosaur for now is Nyasasaurus (new fossils found and dinosaur definition changes)
Within 25 MY of Nyasasaurus, global disperal of dinosaurs -- range in length from 1m to 11m, from 6% of terrestrial amniotes to 60%

Was success due to skill or luck?
Luck:
	Late Triassic mass extinction cleared away many competitors (like Archosaurs)
	One of the six largest known mass extinctions, probably tied to volcanism
	Palisades in New York show evidence of Late Triassic mass extinction

Skill:
	But did changes in stance and physiology give dinosaurs an edge?

William Buckland: What rules the World? The stomach: the great eat the lesser and the lesser eat the lesser still
Buckland thought dinosaur evolution based on different ways of getting or processing food

Changes in Stance:
	Dinosaur line was one of the first to achieve an erect stance (meaning the limbs are directly underneath the body, not 2 vs. 4 limbs)
	Sprawling stance: What crocodiles and alligators have
	Semi-sprawled stance: All early mammals had this, platypuses have it today
	Erect: Dinosaurs

Lizards, although they're fast, have to twist their body from side to side while they run because of their sprawled stance
But they can't breath while they run due to the twisting, so they have to stop to breathe
Erect stance: up and down motion of the spine helps expand and contract the lungs

Most modern mammals have erect stance
Dinosaurs' early development of the erect stance gave them a huge advantage -- endurance

Dinosaurs and humans are the only bipedal lines in Earth's history, which also gave dinosaurs a huge advantage
Having two free limbs can go a long way in predation
Bipedal stance frees up the forelimbs to do stuff other than running (tool use, flying like in birds)
Humans have an S-shaped spine in order to handle bipedal life

Why did bipedalism evolve if it made childbirth more difficult? Tool use and other benefits offset the cost
Dinosaur tails were really solid and helped balance their weight over their hips
As humans bend over, their hips go back in order to keep weight balanced over their feet
Ostriches don't have long tails, and it looks like their knee is 'backwards'
But that's actually the ostrich's ankle, and its knee much further up its leg
It only runs with the lower part of its leg and its body weight is balanced on its knee rather than its hip
Theropod dinosaurs had the advantage of a long tail, meaning they could make use of their full legs to run

Length of upper leg determines speed of rotation -- longer the upper limb, slower the rotation
Length of lower leg affects length of stride
What you want is a short upper bone, long lower bone, and extended ankles -- not human legs!
Human legs are designed for endurance and not speed
The only large animal that's slower than a human is a sloth

Foot designs
Plantigrade: walking on the bottoms of feet (humans, bears, squirrels) helps with stability
	Humans probably have these because arboreal ancestors needed stability when moving through treesf

Digitigrade: walking on digits (cats, dogs)
	When you're in high heels, you're forced to be in a digitigrade stance. Theropod dinosaurs did it for speed
	Some dinosaurs made it to semi-digitigrade stances (stegosaurs, ceratopsians), but they never made it to plantigrade stance

Unguligrade: walking on tips of toes (horses); elephants are near-unguligrade. This adaptation is for running very fast or for having lots of mass (stress)
	Sauropods were sub-unguligrade (just like elephants and rhinos) -- better design for handling stress of carrying large body mass, extends length of leg for 	more speed

	Horses really only have one main digit left (two vestigial), and they run on the nail of that digit
